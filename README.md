# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis
## **Project Overview**

Analysis of retail transaction and customer data to identify purchasing patterns, high-value customer segments, and key revenue drivers.
The project follows a complete analytics workflow, starting from data quality assessment and cleaning through exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, and business-focused recommendations.


## **Business Objective**
To support data-driven marketing decisions by:

- Understanding what drives total sales
- Identifying high-value customer segments
- Determining which customer groups and product characteristics should be targeted to maximize revenue

## **Key Findings**
- Revenue Skew: A limited number of customer segments account for a disproportionately large share of total sales
- Primary Sales Drivers: Sales performance is influenced more by product category and packet size than transaction frequency alone
- Segmented Behavior Patterns: Distinct differences exist in spend, purchasing frequency, and product preferences across customer life stages
- Targeting Opportunity: Several customer segments show strong engagement but sub-optimal average spend, indicating room for strategic targeting

## **Skills Demonstrated**
- Data Quality Assessment: Identified missing values, incorrect formats, category inconsistencies, and outliers across multiple tables
- Data Cleaning & Integration: Cleaned datasets and merged customer and transaction data into a single analysis-ready structure
- Metric Definition: Total sales, revenue contribution, average spend, and segment-level performance metrics
- Customer Segmentation: Analysis of purchasing behavior across life stages and customer groups
- Data Visualization: Clear charts and graphs highlighting trends, anomalies, and performance drivers
- Business Insight Generation: Translating analytical results into actionable recommendations

## **Tools**
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

## **Dataset**
Retail transaction and customer dataset containing:
- [X] transactions
- Approximately [Y] unique customers
- Customer life stage classifications
- Transaction history covering [date range]
